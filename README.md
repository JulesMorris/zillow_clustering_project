# Zillow Price Prediction
A project using regression to discover drivers of log error and build predictive models to that end. 

## About the Project 

### Project Goals

My goals are to address identify the key features that impact home price in the Southern California market so that I can build a predictive model that accurately predicts single family home and single unit log error and make recommendations to increase the accuracy of predictive power in future models for deployment.

### Project Description

This project looked at features impacting the log error in Ventura, LA, and Orange County. Log error is the difference between the price the home sells for and the price that was predicted by Zillow. Volatility in log error can be distruptive to sellers and consumers that use Zillow's services. Accurately predicting home price is important for not only Zillow, but all customers interested in purchasing a home. The California market is notoriously prohibitive for price sensitive consumers, building an accurate predictive model based on attributes known to drive log error and customizing that to California's unique landscape creates a more knowledgable customer base. 


### Initial Questions


1. Where are these log errors taking place? 
2. Does Orange County have a higher log error than average?
3. Is there a linear relationship between log error and home value?
4. Is there a relationship netween log error and area?
5. Is the log error in LA significantly lower than the log error in Orange County?
6. Is there a linear relationship between log error and year built?

### Project Planning

    Acquire data from the Codeup Database and store the process as a function for replication. Save the function in a wrangle.py file to import into the Final Report Notebook.

    View data to gain understanding of the dataset and to create the readme.

    Create README.md with data dictionary, project and business goals, documentation of the initial hypotheses.

    Clean and prepare data for the first iteration through the data pipeline. Store this as a function to automate the process, store the function in the wrangle.py module, and prepare data in Final Report Notebook by importing and using the funtion.

    Clearly define at least two hypotheses, set an alpha, run the statistical tests needed, reject or fail to reject the Null Hypothesis, and document findings and takeaways.

    Establish a baseline accuracy and document well.

    Train four different regression models.

    Evaluate models on train and validate datasets.

    Choose the model with that performs the best and evaluate that single model on the test dataset.

    Document executive summary, conclusions, takeaways, and next steps in the Final Report Notebook.

    Upload README.md, Data Dictionary, wrangle.py, Project Scratch Notebook, Final Report Notebook


### Steps to Reproduce


For example: 

1. You will need an env.py file that contains the hostname, username and password of the mySQL database that contains the zillow dataset. Store that env file locally in the repository. 
2. Clone my repository (including the wrangle3.py) and confirm .gitignore is hiding your env.py file.
3. Import all libraries in first cell of report, a pip install of any unfamiliar libraries into your local system may be required.
4. Dowload zc_wrangle.py from this repository.
5. Use wrangle to acquire and prep the data. 

#### Wrangle

##### Module (wrangle3.py)

- This module contains user defined functions to acquire and prepare the data.

- These functions:

1. Acquire data from SQL database and store a cached version.
2. Drop outliers using IQR rule.
3. Change column names.
4. Train, test, and split data.
5. Scale data.
6. Scale data based on county.
7. Add features.
8. Impute missing values.
9. Drop unnecessary and redundant columns.


##### Missing Values (report.ipynb)

- Data Start: Rows: 77381, Columns: 67

- Missing values handled following the IQR principle first.

- Columns missing entire rows dropped.

- Columns with no additive value and duplicate columns dropped.

- Missing values imputed.

- Nulls dropped.

- Data retention: Rows: 39687, Columns: 45
